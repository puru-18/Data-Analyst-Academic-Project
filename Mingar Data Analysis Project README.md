# Data-Analyst-Academic-Projects
I would like to showcase the skills I have learnt in some of my outstanding data analysis projects at University Of Toronto. I have linked one of my projects here.
One of them is a creating a statistical consultancy report for a simulated fitness tracking device company called Mingar. This project was worth 50% of our grade,
and I was a catalyst to drive success in my team. Thir project encompasses my excellent writing skills, data visualization, wrangling, and hypothesis testing.
This project encompasses my excellent writing skills as well as data visualization, wrangling, and hypothesis testing. The crux of this project is to show how to 
apply the best model to the given business scenario, whether it is about using normalized tests or non-parametric tests while also making sure model assumptions 
are met. For example, assumptions such as data is independent, continuous, and much more. The project has been done completely using R coding. With these skills, 
I want to apply my data analyst knowledge in workplaces and help businesses grow. This project depict one common trait: using statistical knowledge to convey findings
of analysis to a non-statistical audience in simple and illustrative ways (data visualization).
