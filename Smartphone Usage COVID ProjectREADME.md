# Change in Smartphone Usage Before and During Covid-19-Analyst-Academic-Project

In 2020, the world was faced with a pandemic that forced students to be indoors while
participating in online learning. This caused students to change their lifestyle due to the
restrictions that were put into place in Ontario. Due to the rapid change in studentâ€™s lifestyles, we
decided to conduct a study and use simple random sampling in lecture, tutorials and on Piazza to
determine if there was a change in the average smartphone usage and mental health score for Fall
2022 STA304H5 students, before and during Covid-19. The results that can be obtained from
this study are important as it will shed light on the possible effects of Covid-19 in students' lives
and can be an important factor to consider when choosing a learning method for students
