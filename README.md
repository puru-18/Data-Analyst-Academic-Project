# Mingar-Analyst-Academic-Project
I would like to showcase the skills I have learnt in some of my outstanding data analysis projects at University Of Toronto. I have linked one of my projects here.
This is a project about a simulated fitness tracking device company called Mingar, and the goal is to analyze findings such as, skin tone affect device performance, 
customer demographics. This encompasses my excellent writing skills as well as data visualization, wrangling, and hypothesis testing. The crux of this project is to
show how one applies the best optimized model given a business scenario, whether it be normalized or non-parametric tests while also making sure model assumptions are
met. For example, assumptions such as data is independent, continuous, and much more. The project has leveraged SQL for querying, and the coding has been done completely
in R. With these skills, I want to apply my data analyst knowledge in workplaces and help businesses grow. This project depicts one major fact: using 
statistical knowledge to convey findings of analysis to a non-statistical audience in simple and illustrative ways (data visualization).
