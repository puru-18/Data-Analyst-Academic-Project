# Data-Analyst-Investigating-Effects-on-Blood-Pressure-Project
This project investigates the effect of smoking as well as other health/nutrition factors on combined systolic blood pressure reading. The project incorporates the use of a multi-regression model. I conduct the data analysis by first focusing on Model diagnostics to ensure all assumptions are met, and if any case it is not, then I will need to re-validate the assumptions and investigate furrther. This could mean a transformation or removing some outliers depending on the importance. One way to check for which variables to keep is by examining the variance inflation factor (VIF) for detecting multicollinearity between predictors. Then, choosing one variable selection method such as stepwise regression for AIC, BIC, and then Lasso selection to compare which model will be the best for our given scenario. At last, one needs to cross validate the new regression model to make sure the choosen variable selection method works the best, and make sure all model assumptions for the final model is met. This is the approach taken for this final project. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my data analysis knowledge by performing exploratory analysis and portraying an easy, simple to understand results for a larger general audience.
