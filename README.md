# HELLO

In 2020, the world was faced with a pandemic that forced students to be indoors while participating in online learning. This caused students to change their
lifestyle due to the restrictions that were put into place in Ontario. Due to the rapid change in studentâ€™s lifestyles, our team decided to conduct a study and
use simple random sampling in lecture, tutorials and on Piazza to determine if there was a change in the average smartphone usage and mental health score for
Fall 2022 STA304H5 students, before and during Covid-19. The results that can be obtained from this study are important as it will shed light on the possible 
effects of Covid-19 in students' lives and can be an important factor to consider when choosing a learning method for students. I played an integral role in this
project which was worth 45% of our overall grade. My expertise in making complicated findings in a simpler way, my analytical thinking, communication was greatly 
appreciated in our team. I am really proud of this project that stands close to my heart for a compelling data analyst project that was done through SQL 
(for data anomaly exploration) and coding being done completely in R.
