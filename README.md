# Data-Analyst-Academic-Project

I have always been passionate about decoding societal problems, and trying to make a positive impact in our society. This is one such commendable project I worked on
at University Of Toronto. This project is about the ongoing problems of plastic in our daily lives. Although, its extensive range of applications allows for
economic growth and is therefore a crucial component to many industrial and commercial purposes. However, most types of plastic contain non-biodegradable materials 
which require additional care for proper disposal. Wealthier nations who can afford to offload their share of the burden often do so at the expense of developing 
nations. In many cases, developing nations import plastic waste out of necessity in exchange for monetary benefits but do not have the capacity for a proper disposal,
meaning a significant portion gets expelled to the ocean. This presents the image that developing nations, particularly in the South-Eastern Asia area, are ultimately
responsible for the majority of ocean waste. In this project, I was the team lead, and made sure we all contribute in unique ways to our full potency. We all agreed 
upon creating a data-driven article which examines the origins of ocean plastic and how nations use international trade as a means to dispose of their plastic emission.
We presented innovative new technologies on the rise, as well as some of the best waste management policies that corporations and global leaders can mimic. Ultimately,
plastic emissions has a global effect, and it is in the best interest of everyone to minimize plastic waste expelled to the ocean. We did coding mostly through R,
however, for merging complex datasets, we used SQL and for visualization dashboard we used Tableau which we integrated into R later on. This project was given the 
academic benchmark award in lecture.
