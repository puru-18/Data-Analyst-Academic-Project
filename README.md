# Data-Analyst-Academic-Projects
I would like to showcase the skills I have learnt in some of my outstanding data analysis projects at University Of Toronto. I have linked some of my best projects 
at University Of Toronto as a data analyst. Please have a look at the different branches for a write-up about them, and necessary files with my workings being 
showcased. For example, One is about Global Plastic Emissions, the other is a mini-portfolio project which encompasses my excellent writing skills as well as data visualization, wrangling, and hypothesis testing. The next project is to investigate the effect of smoking and other factors in health/nutrition on combined systolic blood pressure reading. The crux of both projects is to show how different scenarios use different tests, whether it be parametric or non-parametric tests while also making sure model assumptions are met. For example, assumptions such as data is independent, continuous, and much more. Both the projects have been done completely using R coding. With these skills, I want to apply my data analyst knowledge in workplaces and help businesses grow. These projects depict one mutual fact: using statistical knowledge to convey findings of analysis to a non-statistical audience in simple and illustrative ways (data visualization).
