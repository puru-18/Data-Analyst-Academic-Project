# Data-Analyst-Academic-Project
This is an introduction to a mini-portfolio which I have completed to thoughtfully communicate my understanding of statistical
concepts and make decisions on using the best hypothesis testing for a given scenario. I have learnt
new R coding functions in this STA303 class that optimized my time spent on making R coding
efficient and neat. To give a little context about STA303 (Data Analysis II Course at UofT), this course is a Data Analysis II course
for third year students which focuses heavily on technical coding and refining writing and verbal
skills. This is helpful in demonstrating skills such as collaboration, and communication. The
learning objectives of this course is to teach students about data exploratory analysis, not limited
to, wrangling, data visualization, and data cleansing and investigating ethical considerations in
data analysis. Theoretically speaking now, the need to understand assumptions and the usage
cases for linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models, and additive models. Although
these words are too technical, to sum it up, the crux of this course is to well-verse with various
scenarios to be able to R code, and apply data analytical tools learnt in this course for future
settings. This is so we can accurately and appropriately interpret results of different models, and
being able to communicate to a larger general audience.
