# UniSelect - Business Feasibility Analytical-Project

This project showcases my financial side of analytical skills as well as my collaboration skills as I worked with a PepsiCo Financial Analyst manager as well as with a 
team of 7 people. This project is about a simulated education model for a SaaS business venture called "UniSelect". We generated a feasibility report by conducting
a market timeliness analysis, scenario/resource analysis, evaluating and optimizing price model based on research, learning to make an impactful business intelligence report, and assessing KPI factors such as ROI, sales growth. Our venture project "UniSelect" is here to solve a problem in our education industry which is to ease the
workload of guidance counsellors in providing an accurate way for students to choose their post-secondary institution. Our venture model aims to change these conditions by providing a computer application for school guidance offices and high school seniors. The UniSelect application consists of personalized questionnaires that are completed by senior students, who are then matched with the post-secondary institutions best suited to their requirements. It also offers additional services
such as access to university alumni. This project reports our innovative venture idea, as well as leveraging the era of digitalization and AI for revolutionalizing 
the path to choosing a post-secondary institution in a much easier and hassle free way.
